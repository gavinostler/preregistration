## About

This project's original function was to serve as the pre-registation service for a ROBLOX game. I no longer work on this pre-registration game, so I made it public.

> [!CAUTION]
> This code may be messy in some spots, but this game was a learning experience to get back into development using lua.


## File Structure

- Any non-wally packages are stored under src/packages/.
- Any wally packages should be built using the `wally install` command. The default.project.json already has the Packages folder point to the correct location.
- `/src/` - The main code location for this project.

## Tests

This place does not support any testing suite yet.

## Other Information

If you'd like to use any of the packages (under src/packages) offered in this project, feel free! I don't expect them to be used, but if for some unknown reason it fits your requirements please provide credit somewhere along the line.
